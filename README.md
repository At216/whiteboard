# Whiteboard
HTML, JS whiteboard via SVG


## About
This project uses SVG tags within the index HTML to render SVG objects. A JavaScript function tracks mouse movements over the SVG body and appends a dot wherever the left-click
button is pressed or held down. The Download button activates another JavaScript function which packages the SVG drawing into a file and downloads it through the browser. 


## Dependencies
This project uses the 'index.html' file, and references the 'cool logo.png' file as the favicon. 


## Potential applications and uses. 
This project is great for creating SVG sketches that can be shared with other systems - SVG files are lightweight, and most modern browsers support SVG files. This project was created with the intent to build a digital note-taking website that would be compatible with most internet users, and simplify existing digital note-taking websites/apps. For this reason, the SVG sketches can be exported (as an SVG :)  ) and are able to be viewed in the browser.
